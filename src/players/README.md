# Sagenwelt Base-MudLib
## src/players

This directory contains the homedirectories of the players.
These homedirectories are sorted into subdirs according the first letter of
the filename.

Normal players won't have direct read/write access to any files stored in
their directory. This access will be granted as soon as the player is
promoted to wizard!
